## Rooms


### Genres
Rooms will be split up in genres

#### Rooms with playlists per genre
* `#rock`
* `#pop`
* `#90s-00s`
* `#hip-hop`
* `#rnb`
* `#soul`

Probably i would rather want the rooms to be generated by the user. That the room will be accessible for people to join. Then again these would be probably standard in the application.

#### Connects people
When somebody connects to the room people should know who joined. 

By sending and adding these in the playlist you connect with people in the server by adding and connecting with the server.

#### Save playlist?
